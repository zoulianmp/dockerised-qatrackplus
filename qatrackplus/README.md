QATrack+ is a fully configurable, free, and open source (MIT License) web
application for managing QA data for radiation therapy and medical imaging
equipment.  QATrack+ is now used in many hospitals and clinics [around the world](
http://qatrackplus.com/#whos-using)! Visit the QATrack+ homepage at 
http://qatrackplus.com

QATrack+ is deployable on most operating system/server/database platform
combinations. It was developed in the popular Python programming language using
the Django web framework so that QC data may be entered, reviewed, and analyzed
using a web browser.

Take a look at the [screenshots](https://bitbucket.org/tohccmedphys/qatrackplus/wiki/screenshots) to get
an idea of the interface.

The main features include:

* ability to define QC tests via an user-friendly interface. Configuration settings are
available for data type (Boolean, float, computational result, or multiple choice
selection), test frequency (due/past due dates), reference values, and tolerance and action
levels. Test configurations can be grouped and assigned to multiple units/devices to
reduce configuration workload, and to simplify the configuration maintenance.
* several options for trending numerical data via control charts and other tools. Data can be
filtered by unit, date, or frequency, and can also be exported for external analysis.
* support for multiple, unique user groups (e.g. administrators, physicists, assistants,
therapists, etc) with user & group-specific privileges and test lists, as well as a configurable user
authentication system.
* ability to integrate test procedures into data entry forms via embedded html or links to
external documentation.
* ability to save incomplete work.
* ability to configure a review/approval process with additional options for classifying data.
The software also allows reviewers to easily differentiate between measurements
performed as part of investigative work, or as part of routine QC testing.
* optional and configurable email notification.
* the flexibility to host on an intranet or www, requiring minimal resources from IT
departments. Can optionally be managed within a physics department if permitted by
local institution policies.
